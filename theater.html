<h3>The Three Sisters by Anton Chekov</h3>

<pre>
    <name><h4>OLGA.</h4> </name>
    <p>

   <speech>
    Father used to make us get up at seven. Now Irina wakes at seven
    and lies and meditates about something till nine at least. And she looks
    so serious! </p> </speech>
    
    <p><direction>[Laughs.]</p></direction>

    <h4>IRINA.</h4> <p>
    <speech>
    You're so used to seeing me as a little girl that it seems queer
    to you when my face is serious. I'm twenty!</p>
</speech>

    <h4>TUZENBACH.</h4> <p>
    <speech>
    How well I can understand that craving for work, oh God! I've
    never worked once in my life. I was born in Petersburg, a chilly, lazy
    place, in a family which never knew what work or worry meant. I remember
    that when I used to come home from my regiment, a footman used to
    have to pull off my boots while I fidgeted and my mother looked on in
    adoration and wondered why other people didn't see me in the same light.
    They shielded me from work; but only just in time! A new age is dawning,
    the people are marching on us all, a powerful, health-giving storm is
    gathering, it is drawing near, soon it will be upon us and it will drive
    away laziness, indifference, the prejudice against labour, and rotten
    dullness from our society. I shall work, and in twenty-five or thirty
    years, every man will have to work. Every one!</p>
</speech>
    
   <h4>CHEBUTIKIN.</h4> <p> <speech>
    I shan't work.</p> </speech>
    
   <h4>TUZENBACH.</h4> <p> <speech>
    You don't matter.</p></speech>
    
    <h4>SOLENI.</h4> <p>
    <speech>
    In twenty-five years' time, we shall all be dead, thank the
    Lord. In two or three years' time apoplexy will carry you off, or else
    I'll blow your brains out, my pet. </p>
</speech>
<p><direction>[Takes a scent-bottle out of his pocket and sprinkles his chest and hands.]</p></direction>

    <h4>CHEBUTIKIN.</h4> 
    <p><direction>[Laughs]</p></direction>
     <p> 
    <speech>
    It's quite true, I never have worked. After I came
    down from the university I never stirred a finger or opened a book, I
    just read the papers.... [Takes another newspaper out of his pocket]
    Here we are.... I've learnt from the papers that there used to be one,
    Dobrolubov [Note: Dobroluboy (1836-81), in spite of the shortness of his
    career, established himself as one of the classic literary critics
    of Russia], for instance, but what he wrote--I don't know... God only
    knows.... [Somebody is heard tapping on the floor from below] There....
    They're calling me downstairs, somebody's come to see me. I'll be back
    in a minute... won't be long....</p>
</speech>

     <p> 
        <direction>[Exit hurriedly, scratching his beard.] </p></direction>

    <h4>IRINA.</h4> <p>
    <speech>
    He's up to something.</p>
</speech>

    <h4>TUZENBACH.</h4> <p> <speech>
    Yes, he looked so pleased as he went out that I'm pretty
    certain he'll bring you a present in a moment.</p>
</speech>
    <h4>IRINA.</h4> <p><speech>
    How unpleasant!</p> </speech>
    
    <h4>OLGA.</h4> <p> <speech>
    Yes, it's awful. He's always doing silly things.</p> </speech>
    
    <h4>MASHA.</h4>
    <p> <speech>
            "There stands a green oak by the sea.
            And a chain of bright gold is around it...
            And a chain of bright gold is around it...."</p> </speech>
    
    <p>
    <direction>[Gets up and sings softly.]</p> </direction>
    
    <h4>OLGA</h4> <p> <speech>
    You're not very bright to-day, Masha. <p></speech>
   <direction>[MASHA sings, putting on her hat] </p> </direction>
    <p> <speech>
    Where are you off to?</p> </speech>
    
    <h4>MASHA.</h4> <p> <speech>
    Home.</p></speech>
    
    <h4>IRINA.</h4> <p> <speech>
    That's odd....</p> </speech>
    
    <h4>TUZENBACH.</h4> <p> <speech>
    On a name-day, too!</p> </speech>
    
    <h4>MASHA.</h4> <p> <speech>
    It doesn't matter. I'll come in the evening. Good-bye, dear.<p> </speech>
   <direction>[Kisses MASHA]</p> </direction>
    <p> <speech>
    happy returns, though I've said it before. In the
    old days when father was alive, every time we had a name-day, thirty or
    forty officers used to come, and there was lots of noise and fun, and
    to-day there's only a man and a half, and it's as quiet as a desert...
    I'm off... I've got the hump to-day, and am not at all cheerful, so
    don't you mind me. [Laughs through her tears] We'll have a talk later
    on, but good-bye for the present, my dear; I'll go somewhere.</p> </speech>
    
    <h4>IRINA.</h4> <p>
    <direction>[Displeased]</p> </direction>
    <p><speech>
    You are queer....</p> </speech>
    
    <h4>OLGA.</h4> <p>
     <direction>[Crying]</p> </direction>
     <p> <speech>
    I understand you, Masha.</p> </speech>
    
    <h4>SOLENI.</h4> <p> <speech>
    When a man talks philosophy, well, it is philosophy or at any
    rate sophistry; but when a woman, or two women, talk philosophy--it's
    all my eye.</p> </speech>
    
    <h4>MASHA.</h4><p> <speech>
    What do you mean by that, you very awful man?</p></speech>
    
    <h4>SOLENI.</h4> <p><speech>
    Oh, nothing. You came down on me before I could say... help!</p></speech> <p>
    <direction>[Pause.]</p></direction> 
    
    <h4>MASHA.</h4> <p>
    <direction>[Angrily, to OLGA]</p> <p> </direction>
    <speech>Don't cry!</p></speech>
    
    <p> <direction>[Enter ANFISA and FERAPONT with a cake.]</p> </direction>
    
    <h4>ANFISA.</h4> <p><speech>
    This way, my dear. Come in, your feet are clean.</p> <p> </speech>
    <direction>[To IRINA]</p>  </direction>
    <p> <speech>
    From the District Council, from Mihail Ivanitch Protopopov... a cake.</p> </speech>
